# LingQWordsExport
Will export all your words from **LingQ** https://lingq.com
to a tab-separated UTF-8 **text** file, **Html**, and **Anki**.

THE APP IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW, EVERYTHING'S PROVIDED AS IS... <br>

Look for the documentation in the [LingQWordsExport doc folder](https://github.com/SergeyFM/LingQWordsExport/tree/master/doc) .<br>

Here is an application that can download word definitions from LingQ learning portal.
The app can try to restore capitalization, which is important for German language:<br>
    – essen (to eat) – das Essen (the food/the eating)) <br>
In addition, pictures and audio are automatically downloaded.
With this data the application can make html learning pages and anki files.

1. Make sure you have **Java 11+ installed**

2. **Edit config.ini**

3. **Run LingQWordsExport_RUN.bat** 

4. Review **html files with words**

5. **Import data to Anki**

6. **Enjoy**

I tested this all on a Windows 10 machine. There should be no particular problems running it on other platforms, please let me know how it goes for you. <br>
If the file with words (file_name) is found, it will be loaded, if not - the words will be downloaded from LingQ.
Run several instances of the app to download audio and image file faster (I trided 4 in parallel).

I'm open for suggestions and help. I wish y'all huge success with language learning!
