## My daily routine.

Here you can find a [documentation](doc/README.md) page. <br>

In this document I show my daily routine. First I read on LingQ and then study new words in Anki.


### I read and mark words on LingQ.

### Then run the LingQWordsExport app.

### It gets 10 new definitions from LingQ. Downloads images and sound for each one of them.

### There is a new html file now.

I can see and hear the words I've saved today, the pictures chosen.

### And finally I import new words to Anki.
Copy new media files to the Anki media folder.

### Everything's ready! Don't' forget to sync data if you want it to be available on all your devices.
