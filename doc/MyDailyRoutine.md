## My daily routine.

Here you can find a main [documentation](README.md) page. <br>
In this document I show my daily routine: first I read the news and my books in LingQ, then I import and study new words in Anki.
<br> After initial set up, importing takes only a few minutes.

### I read and mark words on LingQ.

### Then run the LingQWordsExport app.

### Today I got 10 new definitions from LingQ. Download images and sound for each one of them.

### And finally I import new words to Anki.
Copy new media files to the Anki media folder.

### Everything's ready! Don't' forget to sync data if you want it to be available on all your devices.
