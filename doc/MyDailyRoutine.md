## My daily routine.

### It gets 10 new definitions from LingQ. Downloads images and sound for each of them.

### There is a new html file now. I can see and hear the words I've saved today, the pictures chosen.

### Everything's ready! Dont' forget to sync data if you want it to be available on all your devices.
